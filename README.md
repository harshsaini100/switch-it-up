# Switch It Up - Multi-Theme React App

This is a responsive React application built as part of a frontend development assignment. It allows users to switch between **three completely different themes**, each with its own layout, fonts, colors, and structure. The app fetches data from an API, includes routing, and maintains state using the Context API.
